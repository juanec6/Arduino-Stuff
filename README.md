# Arduino Learning & Agro-Automation Projects

This repository is a personal log of my progress learning **Arduino** and developing small systems with a focus on **agronomic automation**.  
My goal is to explore, experiment, and build prototypes that could help improve efficiency in agriculture — from simple sensor readings to automated systems.

---

## 🌱 Purpose

- Track my learning journey with Arduino and embedded systems.
- Document the different projects I build (successful or not).
- Explore how automation can be applied in agricultural environments.
- Share code, wiring diagrams, notes, and insights for future reference.

---

## 🔧 Current Areas of Exploration

- Basic Arduino programming fundamentals
- Servo control and motor drivers
- LCD and user interface displays
- Sensor data acquisition (soil moisture, temperature, light, etc.)
- Relay control systems for pumps / lighting
- Automating simple greenhouse or garden tasks

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each project includes:
- Source code
- Circuit diagrams or wiring notes
- Observations & lessons learned

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Develop a small-scale **automatic plant care system**
- Learn more about IoT integration (ESP8266 / ESP32)
- Eventually design complete autonomous agronomic systems
